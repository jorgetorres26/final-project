            <p> Around the World is designed to help people find fun and exciting destinations to travel to. 
            It isnâ€™t for users that have a specific goal in mind or want to purchase travel options here, 
            it is merely to allow people to see what is doable and help if they are just 
            starting the search for a vacation. We allow users to explore different 
            destinations around the world through the Explore secton to find places that may interest them and, 
            while also providing the Adventure
             quiz that may help them plan the trip with some insight as opposed to blindly looking 
            around the web for something they might not even enjoy. This is more tailored to the user. It  
            communicates information regarding locations on a map and special recommended destinations
            with fun and adventure in mind. This is a website geared towards giving 
            our users something new. </p>

             <p>
             Our Explore feature allows users to quickly search for destinations according to their moods and wants. The 
             Adventure feature contains a quiz that will ask the user for information like: budget, number of people, hobbies, etc to 
             determine destinations that are most suitable. The Discover section presents the top rated destinations per interest as picked 
             from our team of travelers and developers. Our team did a lot of research to hand-pick only the best destinations for each interest
            in the entire world.
