Around the World is designed to help people find fun and exciting destinations to travel to. 
It isnâ€™t for users that have a specific goal in mind or want to purchase travel options here, 
it is merely to allow people to see what is doable and help if they are just starting the search for a vacation.
We allow users to explore different destinations around the world through the Explore secton to find places that 
may interest them and, while also providing the Adventure quiz that may help them plan the trip with some insight 
as opposed to blindly looking around the web for something they might not even enjoy. This is more tailored to the user. 
It communicates information regarding locations on a map and special recommended destinations with fun and adventure in mind.
This is a website geared towards giving our users something new.

Our Explore feature allows users to quickly search for destinations according to their moods and wants.
The Adventure feature contains a quiz that will ask the user for information like: budget, number of people, 
hobbies, etc to determine destinations that are most suitable. The Discover section presents the top rated
destinations per interest as picked from our team of travelers and developers. Our team did a lot of research 
to hand-pick only the best destinations for each interest in the entire world.

The Explore section uses the Google Places API and Leaflet to display attractions based on user input. The quiz also 
uses that API to search for destinations based on the user input. The Discover section contains attractions suggested 
and researched by us, giving the users our picks for top destinations around the world for different activities. The data
in the Discover section is also used in the home page's slideshow.
